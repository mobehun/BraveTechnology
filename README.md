Issue tracker for the Brave Technology - New World modpack

#I. Introduction
This is a highly experimental modpack, changes are bound to happen.

A simple modpack for those who have not yet played Minecraft 1.10. With the help of quest you can learn some of the mods included in the pack. The pack in itself is really close to the original one but now it's in a newer version. Some of the mods have been replaced, some are missing but the goal is the same.

Only minor changes have been made to the configs and I try to keep everything up to date.
